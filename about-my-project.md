[Contents of Cannabinoids in Hemp Varieties Grown in Maryland](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.1c04992?ref=pdf)

Problem: There is a lack of reasearch available to growers and breeders regarding the cannabinoid contents of various varieties of cannabis.

Approach: During this project, I will support a number of efforts including:

  - 
  - 
  - 

Outcomes of Prior Research: "In summary, low uniformity between varieties was extensively seen for the tested cannabinoids, which probably was a combined effect of genetic diversity, environmental conditions, and growersâ€™ operation. Low uniformity within variety regarding cannabinoid content was observed as well, illustrating the need for improving genotype consistency of cannabis and optimizing the cultivation conditions. (83,84) The results of this research provide reference information for the selection of hemp varieties for cannabinoid production purposes as to high yield and uniformity."
