During the first week, the cohort had the opportunity to build on Python and Github fundamentals and meet with our research teams. I thoroughly enjoyed the "Think Like a Programmer" presentation by Clyde on Day 2 and thought he executed it very well. I particularly appreciated his emphasis on documentation and the Scavenger Hunt. Some terms and concepts that stood out the most to me were model building with logistic regression, data splitting, operator precedence, and the Belmont Principles.
