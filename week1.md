During the first week, the cohort had the opportunity to build on Python and Github fundamentals I met with my team and mentors to discuss the project that I'll be working on and gained an understanding of what Dr. Crawford will be looking for. 
Dr. Crawford also explained to me what, "Physiological Computing Education", is along 
with the differences between EEG and EMG.
