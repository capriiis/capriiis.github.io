During the seventh week, my group presented our project to the rest of the program for the Mid-Summer Symposium. 
An opportunity to share our project objectives, prelimary findings, individual contributions, and next steps, 
the symposium was a great opportunity to learn about the other projects that are underway and how our work intersects.
