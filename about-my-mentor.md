## About My Mentor

My appointed mentor for the CEAMLS Summer AI Research Institute is Dr. Jiangnan Peng, Assistant Professor of Chemistry at Morgan State University. "Dr. Peng's research interests focus on the identification and analysis of bioactive components from natural resources, including plants, fungi, microbes, and marine invertebrates. His research program explores natural products in three major fields: (1) Discovery of new drug leads from natural resources for the treatment of human diseases such as cancer and infectious diseases, using bioassay-guided isolation, structure elucidation, and chemical optimization; (2) Investigation of the scientific basis of dietary supplements and herb medicines, through studying the bioactive components and pharmacology, and establishing comprehensive analytical methods for better control the quality of them; (3) Development of new botanical drugs."
