During the eight week, I worked one-on-one with my graduate mentor build a SQL database. I began the process by sourcing a dataset
from Kaggle and using LucidChart to build out tables for the database. I eencountered some challenges identifying a compatible 
version of Python to install locally, but resolved the issue by installing VSCode instead. I'm now working through errors I've encountering attempting to connect my database to VSCode. I've installed a number of plugins and am digging through Youtube, documentations and forums to find a resolution.
