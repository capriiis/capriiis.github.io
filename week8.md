title: SAIRI Week 8: Building a SQL Database
author: Capri Shorter
---

During the eighth week, I worked one-on-one with my graduate mentor to build a SQL database. I began the process by sourcing a dataset
from Kaggle and using LucidChart to build out tables for the database. I eencountered some challenges identifying a compatible 
version of Python to install locally, but resolved the issue by installing VSCode instead. I'm now working through errors I've encountered while attempting to connect my database to VSCode. I've installed a number of plugins and am digging through Youtube, documentation and forums to find a resolution.
