During the ninth week, I successfully connected my database to VS Code and worked through some of the top SQL interview questions.
I watched different Youtube videos unpacking SQL commands and most useful functions. I also attended a presentation by NSA during 
which I learned about the current state of governance and regulation of AI for national security measures.
