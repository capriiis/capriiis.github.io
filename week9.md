title: SAIRI Week 9: SQL Commands + AI Governance
author: Capri Shorter
---

During the ninth week, I successfully connected my database to VS Code and worked through some of the top SQL interview questions.
I watched different Youtube videos unpacking SQL commands and most useful functions. I also attended a presentation by NSA during 
which I learned about the current state of governance and regulation of AI for national security measures. Following the presentation,
I asked one of the presenter's how the NSA navigates and communicates failure considering most of the AI governance initiatives are
new. Their response affirmed my stance in 'failing fast" and ensuring transparent communication for proper pivots to be made.
