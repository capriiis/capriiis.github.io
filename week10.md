During the final week, I attended the End of Summer Symposium and observed presentations from other project teams.
It was great witnessing the growth in the students' presentation skills. There was a noticeable change in the teams'
communication of their project objectives, methodology, and findings. They transparently and confidently shared 
their challenges and accomplishments and spoke to the future or intended state of the work and its potential impacts.
I am currently reflecting on the entire experience to provide feedback that can drive future improvements for the institute.
