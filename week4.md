During the fourth week, I continued diving deeper into literature relevant to AAVE, SAE, biased and fairness in LLMs, racial disparity in NLP, sociolinguistics, narrative analysis, and prompt engineering techniques. I reviewed the cleaning of a dataset with one of my graduate
mentors and completed the cleaning of another on my own. I plan to continue to discuss the philosophy and methodology of our approach, what's in and out of scope, metrics, DoD, LLM outputs, acceptance criteria, cultural and ethical implications, and more with my team in Week 5.
