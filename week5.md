During the fifth week, my group prepared a presentation for a group of high school students that was very well received. 
We completed annotating our clean data and are now preparing for a compartive analysis of our labels to weigh our responses. 
Instead of Twitter data that we had originally inteded to use, the data we're using is a transcribed conversation. The challenge 
with using the transcribed conversation that we're using instead of Twitter data is that the conversation lacks explicit expressions 
of emotions. Twitter data, unlike the transcribed conversation, offers an opportunity for clearer expressions and the detection and 
labeling of a wider range of emotions, resulting in a better trained, more emotionally intelligent, and culturally competent model.
The audio for the transcribed conversation was inaudible at many points within the conversation and identifying emotions within 
the text was challenging at times due to missing context. I am interested to see the results of the comparative analysis with my
group in Week 6.
